// Problem:

// Given a list of integers and a target value, find the shortest subarray 
// that has a sum equal to the target value. If there are multiple solutions, 
// return the one with the smallest length.
// example: [2, 7, 11, 15, 20, 14, 2, 11, 10] target = 36 => [2, 7, 11, 15, 20, 14]
const input = [2, 7, 11, 15, 20, 14, 2, 11, 10]
const targetValue = 36
